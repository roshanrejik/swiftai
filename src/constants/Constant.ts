    heading:`Calculating Your Runner’s Point Score with Al`,
    content:`To effectively design interval training workouts \n on the track, XC or long-distance sessions on the road, it’s essential to understand each runner’s performance levels. The foundation of this process involves selecting a standard race or time trial for each runner, referencing the AI scoring tables to find their point score, and using that score as a benchmark for shaping future workouts. For example, consider a runner who has completed a 5000 meters in 14:30 (averaging 4:38 per mile). This performance corresponds to a point score of 762. With that score in hand, you can estimate what the runner might achieve in other distances, such as the mile or 10K. In the 10K scoring table, 762 points align with a projected time of 30:45 (or 4:56 per mile). Conversely, in the AI mile scoring table, 762 points suggest a time of 4:17. However, it's crucial to note that if a runner hasn’t focused on long-distance training, they may not realistically achieve their marathon performance at the same 762 point level (which would be around 2:29:00).Every runner has a distinct set of point scores that span various race distances. It’s vital to remember that the AI point score serves as a guideline. On any given day, a runner might exceed their typical score during a race or time trial, or they might perform exceptionally well in a workout that doesn’t necessarily translate into race performance. Nevertheless, if a runner consistently achieves a specific point score during workouts.`,

    table:"Pacing Tables",
    heading:`Pacing Tables in AI for Interval Training from 100 - 2000 points level`,
    content:`You’ve identified that your runner operates at the 412-point level. Now, you want to incorporate interval training on the track. This app provides foundational instructions for effectively using the Pacing Tables for Interval Training, while a subsequent section will focus on road running (for further details, refer to the "Pacing Tables for Long-Distance Running"). The Pacing Tables for Interval Training are recalibrated at every 50-point increment. Since 412 falls around the midpoint between 400 and 450, it’s advisable to start your runner at the 400-point level and then progress from there, referencing the pacing table sample for the 400-point level. \n \n
The fundamental workout is derived directly from the tables: have your runner select an entry and execute the workout as prescribed. For example, at the 400-point level, there are numerous equivalent workouts available. The table features 150 different workouts for each point level, but in reality, there are countless combinations since you can mix and match across the app. As the coach, your focus should be on the specific workout you want each category of runner to undertake. Each individual then performs their workout based on the times designated for their respective point level. Consequently, for a specific workout, each runner in the group will have a unique time to aim for. For instance, if you have five runners on your team, and you want them to complete 12 x 500m intervals, you would consult the pacing table to find the closest 500m time for each runner’s ability. A runner at the 700-point level would complete each interval in 1:25, while a 400-point runner would target 2:05. Keep in mind that the pacing tables can also serve as a predictor of your runner’s future performance in races or time trials. As a runner enhances their training, they’ll likely execute the intervals at a pace corresponding to a higher point level in the tables. This offers insight into the runner’s potential performance at that elevated level during a race. For example, if a runner at the 412-point level consistently performs intervals at the 480-point level, they are anticipated to improve their race performance to match that level, potentially reducing their 5000 meters time from 20:30 to approximately 18:45. Before proceeding, it’s essential to consider that some runners excel during workouts while others shine in competitions. If you notice this discrepancy, take it into account. You might find that the runner performs intervals at a higher point level in practice than in actual races. The coach should consider this when translating workouts to racing scenarios.`,

    heading:`Intermediate "Split" Tables for 400m pace`,
    content:`The Intermediate "Split" Tables are valuable tools for calculating the time required to run a non-standard distance when you know the 400m pace. A sample of an intermediate "split" table can be found in the app. For instance, let’s say you want someone to run 200 meters at a pace of 22.5 for each 200m. While you could calculate this with a calculator, it’s much easier to use the table. Referring to the sample table, you can see that the 200m time for a 22.5 200m pace is 46.9 seconds. These tables simplify the process of determining times for intermediate distances based on a specified 400m pace. Another practical application of these tables is to easily ascertain the 400m pace for a non-standard distance. For example, if someone completes 250m in 54.0 seconds, you can determine that they are running at a 1:30 400m pace.`,

    table:`Reduce Speed Tables`,
    heading:`Ask AI Reduced Speed Tab`,
    content:`When you want your runners to train by covering longer distances, it’s essential to have them slow down and run at a more manageable pace. You can often estimate how much to decelerate based on a percentage of their maximum speed. This means you’ll want to determine the pace per mile or per kilometer for that reduced speed percentage. Alternatively, you might be interested in identifying a specific slower pace as a percentage of their full speed. The Reduced Speed Tables were created to aid in these scenarios. There are both "Per Mile" and "Per Kilometer" tables since some runners prefer thinking in terms of mile pace while others favor kilometer pace.\n \n A sample of the Reduced Speed Table in the "Per Mile" format can be found on the Al app . Just asks AI per-mile or per-kilometer pace, ask AI a list of percentages from 90% down to 65%, representing the percent of velocity for the given pace. For instance, if your runners were clocking a 5:30 per mile pace and decided to slow down to 80% of that velocity, they would be running at a 6:52 per mile pace. Similarly, if they maintained a 6:52 per mile pace for a longer run, it would indicate that they were operating at 80% of their 5:30 per mile pace. These tables are frequently used alongside the Pacing Tables for Long Distance Running, allowing you to determine the appropriate pace for a long run effectively.`,

    table:"LDR Pace Tables",
    heading:`Using the Pacing Tables in AI for Long Distance Running, per-mile and per-kilometer tables are invaluable`,
    content:`When your runners are engaged in long-distance training, it’s important to determine the total time they should run for a given distance based on the goal pace you set. Alternatively, you might know the total time they ran for a specific distance and want to easily calculate the pace for that run. The Pacing Tables for Long Distance Running provide a straight forward method to compute the pace and/or total time. A sample of a Pacing Table for Long Distance Running is available in the app.\n \n 
On the left side, you’ll find the per-mile or per-kilometer pace, and to the right, several distances with the total time displayed if the runner maintains that pace throughout. For example, at a 5:45 mile pace, the time for a 10K would be 36:00. If a runner completes a half-marathon in 1:18:45, their per-mile pace would be easily calculated as 6:00 per mile. These per-mile and per-kilometer tables are invaluable for planning long-distance training runs since pace is a critical factor.\n \n 
When deciding how far your runners should go for a longer, slower distance, a good rule of thumb is to have them run between 50% further than their typical or average distance at about 85-87.5% speed, up to 100% further at around 75-77.5% speed. For instance, if a runner can complete four miles at a 7:30 per mile pace (30:00 total), you would suggest they run at around 8:45 per mile for a 6-mile run (50% longer) and at approximately 9:50 per mile for an 8-mile run (100% longer). This serves as a general guideline; advanced runners may maintain a slightly higher percentage of speed, while less experienced runners might run at a marginally lower pace.`,
